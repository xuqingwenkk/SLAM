# SLAM

I have read some papers about SLAM. Now I want to implement visual SLAM.

Part1: Fisheye calibration and undistortion
lib: OpenCV 2.4 
The field of fisheye lens: 235 degree

Part2: Structure from motion
first push: feature extraction and get good matches
second push: structure from motion between two images, but do not know how to check.
